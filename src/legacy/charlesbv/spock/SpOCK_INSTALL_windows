The directory where SpOCK is installed is noted <spock_dir>. 

To install SpOCK, administrator privileges are not required.

You first need to install Cygwin, see document "Cygwin_INSTALL". 
Once Cygwin is installed, follow the instructions below.

- open a Cygwin terminal 
- cd <spock_dir>
- mkdir gsl_installation

- Download and install GSL C version:
   - go online to http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ 
   - in Section "Downloading GSL", select the link of "your nearest GNU mirror"
   - scroll all the way to the bottom of the page and select "gsl-latest.tar.gz"
   - in Cygwin terminal: 
      - cd to the Downloads directory (usually /cygdrive/c/Users/<username>/Downloads)
      - tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz (if there is no gsl-latest.tar.gz then 
      try "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar")
      - cd to the GSL folder created by this previous "tar -zxvf gsl-latest.tar.gz" step 
      (at the time of writing: cd gsl-2.4)
      - ./configure --prefix=<spock_dir>/gsl_installation/ (the --prefix option will install GSL 
	 in the gsl_installation folder previously created so that administrator privileges are not 
	 required for the installation. If you don't want to install GSL in this directory, you'll have 
	 to modify the makeall.sh accordingly (see further step))
      - make (this step might take several minutes)
      - make install (IF (and only if) you didn't use the option --prefix two steps before, then you might need 
	 administrator privileges: sudo make install)
You're done installing GSL.

- Download and install SPICE for C:
   - go online to: http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit_C.html
   - select the 64-bit Cygwin version "PC, CYGWIN, gCC, 64bit"
   - download cspice.tar.gz (you don't need to download the other files. In particular, 
   don't follow the instructions of the README file. At the time of writing, they don't work properly. 
   Instead, follow the following steps.)
   - in the Cygwin terminal:
      - cd to the Download directory (usually /cygdrive/c/Users/<username>/Downloads)
      - cp cspice.tar.gz <spock_dir>
      - cd <spock_dir>
      - tar -zxvf cspice.tar.gz
      - cd cspice
      - ./makeall.csh (this might take a few minutes)
You're done installing SPICE.

- Install SpOCK:
   - still in the Cygwin terminal:
      - cd <spock_dir> 
      - ./makeall.sh (IF (and only if) you installed GSL in another directory than gsl_installation 
      (see step "./configure in the installation of GSL") then modify the variable "path_gsl" in makeall.sh)
      - source ~/.bash_profile
You're done installing SpOCK.

- Give it a try!
   - open the file <spock_dir>/Examples/try_spock.txt and modify the line below #SPICE to: <spock_dir>/cspice/data (don't forget 
   to change <spock_dir> with the directory where SpOCK was installed). For example, if spock_dir is 
   /cygdrive/c/Users/smith/spock then the line under #SPICE should be /cygdrive/c/Users/smith/spock/cspice/data. 
   Then save try_spock.txt and go back to the Cygwin terminal
   - cd <spock_dir>/Examples
   - mpirun -np 2 spock.exe try_spock.txt
If the installation of SpOCK went well, then you shouldn't see any error. 
The message:
"SpOCK is propagating the spacecraft... 100%

- Done propagating the spacecraft."
should be printed on the Cygwin terminal.
You might see a window that pops up asking you the authorization to run the executable spock or orterun. You 
can hit Cancel. It shouldn't pop up next time. 
To plot the altitude, longitude and latitude of the simulation you just run:
python plot_output.py try_spock.txt
It will create 3 plots in the current directory: altitude.pdf, longitude.pdf,
and latitude.pdf (one line per satellite on each plot).

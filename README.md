## Installation

### With Conan + CMake

#### 1 - Get Conan and CMake
[Conan](https://conan.io/) is one of the leading options for cross-platform package
manager for C/C++ projects. We chose it because it interfaces with CMake in a nice
way. Conan will handle the dependencies and version conflicts management, and pass
the paths of the installed dependencies to CMake so it can build the project.

[CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html) is the C++ build systems first choice for cross-platform development. Technically, CMake is a build system generator but the
level of abstraction it offers allows us to consider it as a cross-platform build system.
Users can build, test, and install packages with `cmake` and `ctest` commands.

> :bulb: For devs, if you want more background on how Conan and CMake interact, check:
> - [the CMake official documentation](https://docs.conan.io/en/1.36/integrations/build_system/cmake.html)
> - [this post](https://jfreeman.dev/blog/2019/05/22/trying-conan-with-modern-cmake:-dependencies/).

#### 2 - Configure Conan on your system :wrench:

> :bulb: These steps generally have to be done only once, when you first configure your system. If you change the `build_type` (eg. `Release` or `Debug`) then you will need to reinstall the dependencies, as their version may change according to the build type.


##### Set up the Conan profile

[Conan profiles](https://docs.conan.io/en/latest/reference/profiles.html) allow users to freeze a complete configuration set for settings, options, environment variables, and build requirements in a single file.

Profile can be created with `new` option in `conan profile` (detecting local system settings like the OS) and edited later (to add the SpOCK-specific settings):

```bash
$ export myprofile=spock-profile
# User specific settngs
$ conan profile new ${myprofile} --detect
# SpOCK specific settings:
$ conan profile update settings.compiler=gcc ${myprofile}
$ conan profile update settings.compiler.version=10 ${myprofile}
$ conan profile update settings.compiler.cppstd=20 ${myprofile}
$ conan profile update env.CC=[/usr/bin/gcc-10] ${myprofile}
$ conan profile update env.CXX=[/usr/bin/g++-10] ${myprofile}
$ conan profile update conf.tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja ${myprofile}
$ conan profile show ${myprofile}
```

The last command should show something similar to (if you're on Linux):
```ini
Configuration for profile spock-profile:

[settings]
os=Linux
os_build=Linux
arch=x86_64
arch_build=x86_64
compiler=gcc
compiler.version=10
compiler.libcxx=libstdc++
build_type=Release
compiler.cppstd=20
[options]
[conf]
tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja
[build_requires]
[env]
CC=['/usr/bin/gcc-10']
CXX=['/usr/bin/g++-10']

```

##### Add the Bincrafters remote package repository

By default, Conan only searches for packages from the two central repositories hosted and moderated by **Conan.io** staff: `conan-center` and `conan-transit`. We will need packages that are not hosted by these official repositories.

The [Bincrafters](https://bincrafters.github.io/2017/06/06/using-bincrafters-conan-repository/) community posts new packages/versions every week in a separate Conan repository. To start using any of the Bincrafters packages, run:

```bash
$ conan config set general.revisions_enabled=1
$ conan remote add bincrafters https://bincrafters.jfrog.io/artifactory/api/conan/public-conan
```

##### Install the dependencies

First you need to chose a build type:

```bash
$ export build_type=Release
# export build_type=Debug
```
Then you can install all the the dependencies listed in the `conanfile.txt`at the root of the project:

```bash
# Lets start in the project root folder containing the conanfile.txt
$ mkdir build && cd build
# Install both debug and release deps and create the toolchain
$ conan install .. \
--profile:build=${myprofile} \
--settings build_type=${build_type} \
--install-folder=build \
--build=missing
```

#### 3 - Build, test, install :rocket:

```bash
# Works on Linux, OSX, and Windows.
$ cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=conan_toolchain.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=${build_type}
$ ncpus=$(python -c 'import multiprocessing as mp; print(mp.cpu_count())')
$ cmake --build . --parallel ${ncpus}
$ ctest --parallel ${ncpus}
$ cmake --build . --target install
```

## Project documentation

The project library documentation is built with [Doxygen and automatically published on Github Pages](https://becheler.github.io/SpOCK/).

## Project organization

- `src/` source for the application
- `lib/` source for the application library (*.cpp *.hpp)
- `include/` interface for the library (*.h)
- `tests/` unit test framework
- `doc/` doxygen documentation)

> :bulb: for structure explanation, see [this discussion on SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2360734/whats-a-good-directory-structure-for-larger-c-projects-using-makefile)

## Git branching model

We will use the following workflow:

- `main` branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
- `develop` branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- *supporting branches*: Next to the permanent branches main and develop, supporting branches have a limited time life. They aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and assist in bug/fix tracking. The different types of branches we may use are:
  - `feature` branches
  - `release` branches
  - `hotfix` branches

> :bulb: The rational of this workflow is described in [this article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, the simplest way is to:
- Fork it.
- Clone it to your local system with `git clone XXX.git`
- Make a new branch with `git checkout -b feature`
- Make your changes with `git commit -am "updated code for new feature"`
- Push it back to your repo `git push`
- Click the Compare & pull request button.
- Click Create pull request to open a new pull request.

### Pull Request format

We use [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automate the version labeling, feature tracking and project documentation. Please use informative labels during your PR drafting:

- PRs with that belong to the *Features* category should be labeled with:
  - **feature**
  - **enhancement**
- PRs that belong the *Bug Fixes* category should be labeled with:
  - **fix**
  - **bugfix**
  - **bug**
- PRs that belong to the *Maintenance* category should be labeled
  - **chore**

###Â Conventional Commits Specification

The [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

The commit message should be structured as follows:
--------------------
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
----------------------
Defining commit `<type>`
- `fix:` for a commit that patches a bug (this correlates with **PATCH** in Semantic Versioning).
- `feat:` for a commit that introduces a new feature (this correlates with **MINOR** in Semantic Versioning).
- `chore:` for a maintenance commit
- `docs:` for a documentation update
- `test:` for adding/removing/updating unit tests
- `refactor:` for commits that do not add or remove any feature, but modifies the code design.

## Automated testing

We use a Github Action described in `.github/worflows/cmake.yml` to automatically:
- Install SpOCK dependencies
- Configure CMake
- Build the SpOCK executables
- Test the project using ctest
- Generate the Doxygen documentation
- Deploy the documentation to the Project Github Page

## How to store images and medias

For the use of media (images, videos etc) in the README, we created an empty `media` orphan
branch where the media resources are uploaded to. This allows the master branch to be focused on code.

```
git checkout media
git add XXX.png
git commit -m "adding XXX.png to media branch"
git push origin media:media
git checkout main
```

In the README on branch `main`, the picture can then be referred as `![alt text](../media/XXXX.png?raw=true)`

> :bulb: This usage is documented [here](https://medium.com/@minamimunakata/how-to-store-images-for-use-in-readme-md-on-github-9fb54256e951).

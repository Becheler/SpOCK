## Project documentation

The project library documentation is built with [Doxygen and automatically published on Github Pages](https://becheler.github.io/SpOCK/).

## Project organization

- `src/` source for the application
- `lib/` source for the application library (*.cpp *.hpp)
- `include/` interface for the library (*.h)
- `tests/` unit test framework
- `doc/` doxygen documentation)

## Git branching model

We will use the following workflow:

- `main` branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.
- `develop` branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.
- *supporting branches*: Next to the permanent branches main and develop, supporting branches have a limited time life. They aid parallel development between team members, ease tracking of features, prepare for production releases and assist in bug/fix tracking. The different types of branches we may use are:
  - `feature` branches
  - `release` branches
  - `hotfix` branches

> :bulb: The rational of this workflow is described in [this article](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

## Contributing

If you want to contribute to this project, the simplest way is to:
- Fork it.
- Clone it to your local system with `git clone XXX.git`
- Make a new branch with `git checkout -b feature`
- Make your changes with `git commit -am "updated code for new feature"`
- Push it back to your repo `git push`
- Click the Compare & pull request button.
- Click Create pull request to open a new pull request.

### Pull Request format

We use [Release Drafter](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-drafter) to automate the version labeling, feature tracking and project documentation. Please use informative labels during your PR drafting:

- PRs with that belong to the *Features* category should be labeled with:
  - **feature**
  - **enhancement**
- PRs that belong the *Bug Fixes* category should be labeled with:
  - **fix**
  - **bugfix**
  - **bug**
- PRs that belong to the *Maintenance* category should be labeled
  - **chore**

###Â Conventional Commits Specification

The [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.

The commit message should be structured as follows:
--------------------
```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
----------------------
Defining commit `<type>`
- `fix:` for a commit that patches a bug (this correlates with **PATCH** in Semantic Versioning).
- `feat:` for a commit that introduces a new feature (this correlates with **MINOR** in Semantic Versioning).
- `chore:` for a maintenance commit
- `docs:` for a documentation update
- `test:` for adding/removing/updating unit tests
- `refactor:` for commits that do not add or remove any feature, but modifies the code design.

## Automated testing

We use a Github Action described in `.github/worflows/cmake.yml` to automatically:
- Install SpOCK dependencies
- Configure CMake
- Build the SpOCK executables
- Test the project using ctest
- Generate the Doxygen documentation
- Deploy the documentation to the Project Github Page

## How to store images and medias

For the use of media (images, videos etc) in the README, we created an empty `media` orphan
branch where the media resources are uploaded to. This allows the master branch to be focused on code.

```
git checkout media
git add XXX.png
git commit -m "adding XXX.png to media branch"
git push origin media:media
git checkout main
```

In the README on branch `main`, the picture can then be referred as `![alt text](../media/XXXX.png?raw=true)`
